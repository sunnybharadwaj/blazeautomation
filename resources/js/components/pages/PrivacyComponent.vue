                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy explains how Blaze Automation Inc and its affiliates/subsidiaries handle
                    information, including your Personal Data, that is collected in connection with our websites,
                    products, services, mobile applications, IoT plug-ins and other software (collectively, the
                    “Services”). It explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, who we may
                    disclose it to, and your rights regarding your personal data. By visiting our sites, you acknowledge

                    <h2 class="h3">1. Our Commitment to Protect Your Privacy</h2>
                    <p>At Blaze Automation, we are committed to protecting your Personal Data and your privacy. To
                        ensure that you make informed decisions and feel confident about sharing certain personal
                        information with us, please read this Privacy Policy to understand who we share your Personal
                        Data with and for what purposes, and choices you have concerning how your Personal Data is
                        collected and used by us. We may also provide further privacy collection notices highlighting
                        certain uses of your Personal Data, together with the ability to opt in or out of certain uses,
                        when we collect Personal data from you.</p>
                    <p>Your use of our services is at all times subject to the <a href="/terms-of-us">Terms of Use</a>,
                        which incorporates this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy
                        from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services
                        and/or by sending you an email, unless we do not have your email address. Such notices will
                        still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding
                        them. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time
                        such information is used.</p>
                    <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 13. If you are
                        under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal data about
                        yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under age 13, we
                        will promptly delete the personal data. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided
                        us personal data, please contact us at support@blazeautomation.com.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">2. The Data we collect</h2>

                <h3 class="h4">
                    Personal Data You provide To Us
                </h3>


                <p>We receive and store any personal data you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect personal data such as your name, email address, shipping address, billing address, credit card information, phone number, location name, location including geo-fence, group and device names, device location names, device or room images, Guest User names, Guest User access level information, configuration details, and third-party account credentials (for example, when you use our IoT plug-in service, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, avatars, profile information, images, friends and other authorized information. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We also may send you updates about our services, informational updates, surveys or promotional offers by email if you have given us consent to do so. If at any time you decide you do not want to receive promotional communications from us, you may unsubscribe by clicking “unsubscribe from this list” or “update subscription preferences” in each email that we send to you.</p>

                <p>It is not mandatory to provide any of the personal data described above to Blaze Automation, but if you choose not to, you may not be able to receive any of the Services described below, access certain parts of our websites, or receive information from us that you have requested.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Personal Data Collected Automatically</h3>

                <p>Whenever you interact with our Services (whether via a mobile application, our IoT plug-ins, third party services, App, browser, or other application, connecting a physical device to our services, connecting a third party service to our services, or otherwise), we automatically receive and record information on our servers, logs and databases from your browser, application, services or device(s). In particular, our Services are designed to allow you to connect various physical devices (e.g., the B.One Hub, and associated B.One and third party sensors and other devices) to the Services. While connected to the Services, these devices automatically report information to our servers (including information that you may have provided when setting up or configuring that device), which may include personal data. For example, if you connect a temperature sensor to the Services, the temperature information from that sensor will be transmitted to the Services, along with any identifying information that you have chosen to associate with that sensor (e.g., the device name, Action name, and Room/Location name that you have assigned to the sensor within the Services). The type of information that is collected from each device will vary depending on the device type.</p>

                <p>In addition, if you connect any video or audio recording devices to the Services (e.g., video cameras), and you enable the streaming or recording features of those devices through the service, then video or audio data from those devices may be transmitted to, and stored on, the Services, subject to your configuration and settings. We may capture, process and analyze this video and audio information to provide the Services (e.g., to detect motion or other activity, to provide you with notifications, to provide access to stored audio/video clips, etc.), and as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you choose not to enable video/audio storage or recording services through the Services for a particular device, then B.One does not store the video/audio information streamed from that device.</p>

                <p>Other information collected automatically through the foregoing means may include your IP address, location details, “cookie” information, mobile device, operating system, the type of browser, demographic information, application and/or device(s) you’re using to access our Services, click-through paths, the identity of the page or feature you are requesting or interacting with, time on page of feature, and other indicators of how you are interacting with the Services. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your device that allow us to recognize your browser, application or device and tell us how and when various pages and features in our Services are visited or used and by how many people. In addition, our third party partners, including advertising partners (discussed below), may also use web beacons, or transmit cookies to and read cookies from your browser, application or device when you visit or use our Services (including, without limitation, to collect information in connection with the Google Trusted Stores program or Google Demographics and Interests). Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties. Also, please note that our systems do not currently recognize or respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">3. Who we share your Personal Data with</h2>

                <p>In certain circumstances, we will disclose your personal Data to third parties as described below:</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Aggregated Personal Information that’s no longer personally identifiable</h3>

                <p>We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners or use that information for in marketing or promotional items (“aggregate information”). We may also provide aggregate information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services. However, except as described below, we do not disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Advertisers</h3>

                <p>We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers. You agree that we may provide any of the aggregate information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers (“Targeted Advertising”). For example, we might use the fact you are located in California to show you ads or offers for California businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. In addition to the foregoing, if you have not opted out of our targeted advertising feature as described below, you agree that we may share your personally identifiable information with Advertisers in order to deliver specific targeted advertising or offers to you (“Targeted Advertising”). For example, we might share with our Advertisers the fact that a moisture sensor that you have connected to our Services has detected a flood in order to show you ads or offers for local plumbing services. If we enable Targeted Advertising for our users by default, you will be able to opt out of Targeted Advertising at any time by changing your personal settings.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Partners, Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control</h3>

                <p>In certain situations, partners, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with (“Affiliated Businesses”) may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us), including reselling providing third party devices, or delivering unique or custom Apps. You can recognize when an Affiliated Business is associated with such a transaction or service based on the presence of their brand or a transaction you are conducting directly with that Affiliated Business. We will share your Personal Information with that Affiliated Business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service, and to the extent that you have explicitly accepted incremental terms with that Affiliated Business whereby you acknowledge and authorize us to share your Personal Information. We have no control over the policies and practices of Affiliated Businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an Affiliated Business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. If you decide you no longer want to share Personal Information with an Affiliated Business, you may no longer be entitled to receive certain benefits from the Affiliated Business or have access to the Services without establishing a new account or relationship with B.One.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Agents</h3>

                <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide our products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us as identified in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">User Profiles and Submissions</h3>

                <p>Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user’s name, location, and any content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for B.One’s Services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload content through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,”” if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Business Transfers</h3>

                <p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Protection of B.One and Others</h3>

                <p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of B.One, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">4. How Secure is your Personal Data</h2>

                <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or mobile device and browser or application by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>

                <p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

                <p>The Services may contain links to other sites or applications. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">5. Marketing</h2>

                <p>We may use Personal Data for marketing and promotional purposes, including (i) for sending or showing you updates on latest news, offers and promotions in connection with our products and services (ii) for sending or showing joint marketing offers, loyalty programs, contests and sweepstakes; or (iii) for tailoring and tracking your interactions with internet banner advertisements and links from third party websites to our website.</p>
                <p>We may also use Personal Data to analyze our customers’ preferences and market trends and derive insights, which we may use to tailor the type of products and offers that we present to you. This may involve us combining Personal Data that we hold about your use of our services with information that we have collected about your web usage. We might provide these insights to our third party partners for their marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
                <p>We may communicate marketing and promotions to you by post, telephone, or online and, as appropriate and where required.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">6. Transmission and storage of your Personal Data</h2>

                <h3 class="h4">IT Security</h3>

                <p>No data transmission over the Internet, a website, mobile application or via email or other message service can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of data protection legislation.</p>
                <p>All Personal Data we collect about you is stored on our or our subcontractors’ secure servers. We comply with our security policies and standards when accessing or using this information and restrict access to your Personal Data to those persons who need to use it for the purpose for which it was collected. You are responsible for keeping any information that we send to you confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Exporting your Personal Data</h3>

                <p>Your Personal Data may be transferred outside the country in which you are located, including to countries with a lower level of data protection than in the country in which you are located.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Retention Period</h3>

                <p>We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose for which it was collected and any other permitted linked purpose. Our retention periods are based on business needs and your information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymized.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">7. Your rights and contacting us</h2>

                <h3 class="h4">General rights</h3>

                <p>You have the right to access certain personal Data held about you and correct any inaccuracies. We may charge a reasonable fee for the processing of any data access request in accordance with data protection legislation in your country.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Updating information</h3>

                <p>We will take reasonable steps to try and ensure that your Personal Data is accurate. To help us do this, please notify us of any changes to your Personal Data.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
