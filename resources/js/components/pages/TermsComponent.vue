                <h1 class="highlight">Terms of Use</h1>



                <p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. We’re required to tell you that if you don’t agree to the terms below, you can’t use or access the Services in any manner.</p>

                <p>Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services, mobile applications, IoT plug-ins and other software (collectively, the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or our Services, please contact us at support@blazeautomation.com.</p>

                <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Blaze Automation. You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention.</p>

                <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Privacy</h2>

                <p>Blaze Automation takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current Privacy Policy, please  click here</p>

                <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@blazeautomation.com.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Using the Services</h2>

                <p>In order to use the Services, you may be required to sign up for an account, provide a verifiable email address, provide your name, and select a password and username (which may be your email address) (“ B.One User ID”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your B.One User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p>

                <p>You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or that entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms. You will only use the Services for your personal use and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>

                <p>As part of using the Services, you may create connections between various physical devices (which may be provided by Blaze Automation or by others), third party services, and the Services. You acknowledge and agree that you will not connect any physical devices or third party services to the Services (or otherwise use the Services) in a manner that could be dangerous to you or to others, or which could cause damage to or loss of any property (whether real, personal, tangible or intangible). For example, you should never connect heavy machinery, power tools, medical equipment, or other similar devices to the Services.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</h2>

                <p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any User Submission (as defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:</p>

                <p>1. Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including Blaze Automation);</p>

                <p>2. Violates any law or regulation;</p>

                <p>3. Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</p>

                <p>4. Jeopardizes the security of your B.One account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log on as you on the Services);</p>

                <p>5. Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;</p>

                <p>6. Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;</p>

                <p>7. Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</p>

                <p>8. “Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page or portion of the Services (through use of manual or automated means);</p>

                <p>9. Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content (as defined below);</p>

                <p>Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code of the Services (except (i) for sample or tutorial code examples that we provide on the Services which are clearly marked as such, or (ii) to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law). In addition, if you connect any video or audio recording devices to the Services (e.g., video cameras), you understand and acknowledge that (i) Blaze Automation’s use of any information collected from such devices, including audio/video information, is subject to Privacy Policy, and (ii) you are responsible for obtaining (and you represent and warrant that you have obtained), any and all consents that may be required under applicable local law from all individuals who will be recorded by such devices. Without limiting any other remedy available to SmartThings, a violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Cost of Services</h2>

                <p>Blaze Automation reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain features of the Services. Should you elect to subscribe to such features, you shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Services in connection with such features. Subject to any subscription agreement or other restrictions, Blaze Automation reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon ten (10) days prior notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Services. Use of the Services by you following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Change in Services</h2>

                <p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. In some cases, the changes we make to the Services may cause older hardware devices, third party services, software configurations or setups to no longer work with the Services, and you may be required to upgrade or change these devices, services, configurations or setups in order to continue using the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content (including any Apps or device or external service connections provided by Blaze Automation or by third parties) from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Restrictions to Content in the Services</h2>

                <p>The materials displayed or performed on the Services, including, but not limited to, applications, software and/or services that are designed to operate with the Services, text, graphics, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Blaze Automation’s) rights.</p>

                <p>You understand that Blaze Automation owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>

                <p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Information and data provided by you</h2>

                <p>You may post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide Content, information, or data to or through the Services in various ways. Any Content, information, materials or data that you provide to us in any way through the Services is referred to as your “User Submission.” In addition, when you connect various hardware devices (such as sensors), third party services, or applications with the Services, those hardware devices and applications will in most cases provide information or data to the Services, often in an automated fashion, and we refer to this information and data as “Device Data”. You own your User Submissions and Device Data, and Blaze Automation does not claim any ownership over your User Submissions or Device Data. You grant us certain rights in your User Submissions and Device, as further detailed below. Please note that the following license is subject to our Privacy Policy (to the extent they relate to User Submissions or Device Data that are also your personally-identifiable information). You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all rights to such User Submissions and Device Data and that disclosure and use of such User Submissions and Device Data by Blaze Automation (including without limitation, publishing content on the Services) will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party.</p>

                <p>Subject to our Privacy Policy (where applicable), for all User Submissions and Device Data, you hereby do and shall grant Blaze Automation a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, share, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User Submissions and Device Data in connection with the Services, and Blaze Automation’s (and its successors’ and assigns’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and services).</p>

                <p>Unless explicitly acknowledged or committed to as part of a feature of the Services, Blaze Automation has no obligation to maintain or persist your User Submissions or Device Data for any specified period of time, to guarantee access to User Submissions or Device Data, and has no liability for User Submissions or Device Data submitted to the Services that are or become unavailable through the Services. You hereby grant Blaze Automation a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Services any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback that you provide to Blaze Automation relating to the operation of the Services.</p>

                <p>Blaze Automation does not endorse and has no control over any User Submission. You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Service and all User Submissions provided by you are at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Copyright Infringement</h2>

                <p>We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.

                <h2 class="h3">Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h2>

                <p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>

                <p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>

                <p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party Apps, websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Blaze Automation. When you access third party Apps or websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Blaze Automation is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you use any third party Apps or services or when you leave the Services, and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party App, website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>

                <p>Blaze Automation has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In particular, when you use a App provided by a third party or connect a third party service to the Services, that third party may place additional terms and conditions (including a privacy policy) on your use of that App or any associated services, and you agree that you will comply with all such terms and conditions. We are not responsible for (and do not endorse) any third party terms and conditions, or any third party Apps or services. In addition, Blaze Automation will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party App, site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party App, website or service.</p>

                <p>Your interactions with third party organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services under any transaction you enter into with a third party, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Blaze Automation shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>

                <p>If there is a dispute between participants in relation to the Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that Blaze Automation is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Blaze Automation, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Stopping use of the Services</h2>

                <p>You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at support@blazeautomation.com; please refer to our Privacy Policy  as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have requested deletion of your Services account. Blaze Automation is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Blaze Automation has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>

                <p>Account termination may result in destruction of any User Submissions and/or Device Data associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions or Device Data you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law, these Terms, and the functionality of the Services), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Blaze Automation.</p>

                <p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@blazeautomation.com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.</p>

                <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Using the B.One App available via the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or other Platforms</h2>

                <p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including B.One Apps and iOT plugin (“Application”) available from participating App stores (“Platform”) , but the following additional Terms also apply to the Applications:</p>

                <p>1. Both you and Blaze Automation acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and Blaze Automation only, and not with your Platform, and your Platform is not responsible for the Application or the Content;</p>

                <p>2. The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement as they are applicable to the Services;</p>

                <p>3. You will only use the Application in connection with a device that you own or control;</p>

                <p>4. You acknowledge and agree that your Platform has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;</p>

                <p>5. In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify your Platform of such failure; upon notification, your Platform’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;</p>

                <p>6. You acknowledge and agree that Blaze Automation, and not the Platform, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;</p>

                <p>7. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Blaze Automation, and not your Platform, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</p>

                <p>8. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</p>

                <p>9. Both you and Blaze Automation acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and</p>

                <p>10. Both you and Blaze Automation acknowledge and agree that the Platform and Platforms subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that upon your acceptance of this Agreement, the Platform will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Warranty Disclaimer</h2>

                <p>Blaze Automation does not make any representations or warranties concerning any products (except as expressly set forth below), software, services, information or content contained in or accessing through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Limitation of Liability</h2>

                <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL BLAZE AUTOMATION BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF ANY DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $50 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO BLAZE AUTOMATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Risk of Loss; Insurance.</h2>

                <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, USING THE SERVICES TO SECURE OR OTHERWISE CONTROL ACCESS TO ANY REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY) IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND THAT YOU ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES AND EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF SUCH USE.

In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations here under).</p>

                <p>You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations here under, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Blaze Automation’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Choice of Law; Arbitration.</h2>

                <p>These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof, unless prohibited by law.
